### The RCESM (Regional Community Earth System Model),  or so-called CRESM, is a fully coupled regional model developed jointly by NCAR and Texas A&M University. The model is revision from the coupled regional climate model that is developed from the Texas A&M University. The current verison of the RCESM can be seen in https://ihesp.github.io/rcesm1/introduction.html. 


The goal of this repository is showing a way to operate an automatic RCESM ensemble runs, based on RCESM v1.0. 
The data for the atmosphere component is using GEFS
The data for the ocean component is using Marine Copernicus Analysis Product


This repository is fully tested. 
- The validation report are reported to Texas General Land Office (TGLO)
- The use in research was presented in the AMS 99th Annual Meeting by Dr. Chuan-Yuan Hsu
